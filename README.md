Rock, Paper, Scissors &lt;Lizard, Spock> in various languages, using various, different approaches.

Over Summer 2016 I set myself the task of learning some different programming langauges.  Having had experience in PHP/mySQL and actionScript 2 and 3, I decided to learn Python.  I quickly got to the point where I was confident in Python, so took on the task of learning C.  This repository is full of my experiments programming Rock, Paper, Scissors or Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.  I'm still learning C so my approach and syntax, especially with pointers and character arrays, might be poor -I'm working on it! :)

I'll probably add versions in other languages such as Ruby, Java, etc. as I experiment with them.
